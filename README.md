# To Do List Application

# Home Page
List to do list items that have been created.
Every to do list item should have a "delete" button next to it, that when pressed deletes the item and brings the user back to the home page.
There should be a form at the bottom of the home page that takes a "task" input and submits it to "/create-to-do-list-item"

# Extra
Allow the user to update any to do list item.
